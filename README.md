# BlueStaq-Elevator
This is my submission for the BlueStaq coding challenge.

## How to Build & Run
Navigate to the folder: <i>bluestaq-elevator-app/scripts/</i>

Run the batch files:
* build.bat
* run.bat

Then to see the output of the program,
navigate to the root folder and open
the file <b>bluestaq-elevator-app/system_out.txt</b>

## Configure the application
<b>Due to difficult circumstances, my 
program won't run based on the json
config files found in the <i>bluestaq-elevator-app/resources/</i>
folder.</b>

Please read my notes in: <i>bluestaq-elevator-app/notes.txt</i>
for an explanation.

<b>However</b> You can still configure the file.
You just need to go into the corresponding config
java files and mess with the default parameters.

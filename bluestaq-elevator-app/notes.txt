Notes on this project
1) This program is NOT thread safe.
2) This program could be built in a way to make it threaded, 
     but that's not neccessary to accomplish the goal. No need to overcomplicate.
2.a) How? You could have events created and pushed onto a stack that the building
     could injest. I would need to implement some synchronization of the event handlers.
     I would also need to build a separate elevator request queue that could be 
     synchronized as well. There only needs to be one request queue for every instance
     of the elevator.

/* 
 * ResourceManager
 * Known incomplete class. I failed to get Gson to work.
 * I followed guides online.
 * 1) You will find in my repo that there is a 'scripts' folder that has
 *     how I attempted to manually install the module after downloading it
 * 2) You will also find in the 'libs' folder the .jar file that I used
 * 3) You will see in my pom file that I really tried (several) methods to get
 *     it to work.

/* 
 * So then why not keep trying to get gson until you succeed... :(
 * Normally, I absolutely would, but I have many reasons that I'll explain in person

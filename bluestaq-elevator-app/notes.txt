Notes on this project
1) This program is NOT thread safe.
2) This program could be built in a way to make it threaded, 
     but that's not neccessary to accomplish the goal. No need to overcomplicate.
2.a) How? You could have events created and pushed onto a stack that the building
     could injest. I would need to implement some synchronization of the event handlers.
     I would also need to build a separate elevator request queue that could be 
     synchronized as well. There only needs to be one request queue for every instance
     of the elevator.

/* 
 * ResourceManager
 * Known incomplete class. I failed to get Gson to work.
 * I followed guides online.
 * 1) You will find in my repo that there is a 'scripts' folder that has
 *     how I attempted to manually install the module after downloading it
 * 2) You will also find in the 'libs' folder the .jar file that I used
 * 3) You will see in my pom file that I really tried (several) methods to get
 *     it to work.

 * So then why not keep trying to get gson until you succeed... :(
 * Many reasons! I'll explain in person, but here's the tl;dr
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * I have a full time job that I'm balancing
 * I'm learning java as fast as I possibly can and I promise I can get this
 *   working with just a little bit more dedicated time.
 * I just went through a very difficult breakup
 * I had to move back to my parents (embarassing) for the time being because I have no where else to live
 * I'm trying to get my life back together financially and am having to sell almost all of
 *   my belongings.
 * My truck is damage from slipping into rocks on the ice and I'm trying to get it fixed and traded
 * I'm trying to stay physically active at the gym even though I'm going through a difficult time
 * I'm applying to other jobs just in case, even though I want this job more than anything!
 *   Trust me I've been pouring myself into this as much as I can.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * I'm hopping off my soap box of sob stories for now! Thanks for coming to my TedTalk!
